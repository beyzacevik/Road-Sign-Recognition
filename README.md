# Road Sign Recognition

This project includes different sub-methods to detect and recognize road signs.

These sub-methods are as follows:

- Circle Detection using Hough Space.
- Arrow and Direction Detection using Hough Space.
- Polygon shape detection using contours.
- Color Detection using essential R,G,B values.
- Color Name assignment using Euclidian Distance.


Although this project is developed using only OpenCV based on essential image processing methods, it can be developed further using deep learning techniques. 

Note: There are couple of template based rules to caption the road signs using features extracted by mentioned techniques. So, it is imperfect :)
